        <h2>Construct Development</h2>

        <p>The design, research, and manufacturing of Constructs is Novus Cyber Systems' pride
            and joy. No other cybernetic corporation or manufacturer has ever been able to create 
            this marvelous technology, and they never will. Ever since the United Order/Euro-Asia Coalition
            conflict, no other company in the world has dared set foot in this evergrowing field. In the 
            following tables are our most prominent Combat Constructs that keep the peace, and neutralize 
            the various threats to our United Order.

            <td><h3>Havoc Model :: Assault Class</h3>This Construct boasts heavy armaments combined with state of the art sensors 
                and targeting systems. A 50mm primary gun and a high capacity rocket pod insure 
                maximum effectiviness nearly every terrain. It has been the most commonly used 
                and most effective Combat Construct to date. </td>

            <td id="tdrobo3"><div class="robo3"></div></td>
            <td><h3>Strider Model :: Light Class</h3>The tame cousin of the Havoc model. Striders have the same mobile capabilities as 
                Havocs, but have far better flexibility in urban enviroments. This model was developed 
                initially as a battlefield scout, but its capabilites as a law enforcement Construct 
                quickly spread it into all of our modern cities.</td>

            <td><h3>Ares Model :: Seige Class</h3>One of the prime Heavy Armor Constructs. While not as large as Titan Armor Constructs
                and not as mobile as Assault Constructs, it wields one of the most powerful cannons 
                ever produced by Novus Cyber Systems. A 350mm howitzer capable of devastating damage.
                The Zeus Model, its railgun variant, is capable of destroying hostile ISBMs. </td>
